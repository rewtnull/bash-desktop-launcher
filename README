TODO
        These are just ideas of what I intend to implement. I might or might not
        change my mind about these. Contact me at marcus.hoffren@gmail.com if
        there is something that you really want implemented and I'll see what I
        can do.

        - Human readable session list
        - Optional session element config file
        - Optional sessions path setting
        - Optional internal (in theory more portable) or external (faster) deps
        - Make framebuffer aware. Currently fixed size

OTHER
        Change 'exec' on the final line to 'echo' to try the script without
        launching a window manager.
