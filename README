TODO
        These are just some ideas of what I want to implement.
        Contact me at marcus.hoffren@gmail.com if there is something
        that you really want implemented and I'll see what I can do.

        - Human readable session list
        - Optional session element config file
        - Optional sessions path setting
        - Make framebuffer aware. Currently fixed size

OTHER
        Change 'exec' on the final line to 'echo' to try the script without
        launching a window manager.
